### Welcome to my NextJS Projects Practice Repository! This repository is dedicated to housing various NextJS projects that I will be working on to enhance my skills and understanding of Next.js.

**About**

This repository will serve as a collection of different NextJS projects, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project will be a standalone application focusing on different aspects of Next.js development, including server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, routing, and more.

**Purpose**

The main goals of this repository are:

1. To provide a centralized location for all my NextJS practice projects
2. To track my progress and growth in NextJS development
3. To showcase my skills and understanding of NextJS concepts
4. To serve as a reference for future projects and learning

**Project Structure**

Each project will be contained in its own directory within this repository. The directory name will reflect the project's main focus or functionality. Inside each project directory, you'll find:

- A complete NextJS application
- A README file with project-specific details, including setup instructions and key features
- Any additional resources or documentation relevant to the project

**Technologies**

The projects in this repository will primarily use:

- Next.js
- React.js
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- CSS (may include CSS modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind CSS)
- Various NPM packages as needed for specific project requirements

**Projects**

Project 1: [Creating a Form ](projects/register-form-project)

Description: This project involves creating a user registration form within a Next.js 14 application using the Shadcn component library, React Hook Form, and Zod for client-side validation. The project begins with setting up a Next.js project, installing Shadcn, and organizing the project directory for better code management. Key components like CardWrapper, AUHeader, and BackButton are created for reusability, with Tailwind CSS managing the layout and styling for a responsive design.

The form includes fields for email, name, password, and password confirmation, each with specific validation rules. It demonstrates how to set up a validation schema with Zod and manage form state with react-hook-form's `useForm` hook, showcasing best practices in integrating form validation with backend validation and handling form submission states dynamically. The project also includes a login form, emphasizing the flexibility and reusability of the form components. By the end, you'll have a fully functional, visually appealing registration form ready for integration into any Next.js application.

Project 2: [Dashboard-1](https://github.com/vasanthgx/nextjs-dashboard)

Description: This project focuses on developing a comprehensive full-stack web application using Next.js 14. The dashboard application leverages the Next.js App Router, which simplifies routing and enhances performance with built-in features. The primary goal is to create a scalable and efficient dashboard that offers a seamless user experience, integrating various modern web technologies. The project will explore the benefits of Next.js and how it can be utilized to build robust applications with optimized performance.
